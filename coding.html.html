        <p>It is true that majority of people are living lifes which they are not happy with. Very few people are happy with their lives.
            That does not mean that they don't have problems.They manage to smile despite of their trauma and set backs. Infact smiling is not a sign of happy life.
            Some smiles are masks people wear to hide their inner identity.By saying so I don't mean all people who smile are faking it. No, there are 
            some genuine smiles. Here we will cover what makes people sad with their lives and how to improve their situations. I don't promise a magic pill 
            to make you happy. Instead, what I have is a red pill which you must painfully swallow if you want to improve your situation.

            Mostly, we are the product of our choices. I don't go against the fact that there are some outcomes which are beyond our control. It is undisputable that some 
            of our outcomes are controlled by God. But it will be insane to relax and hope that God will control everything. It is highly probable that we have a big control 
            over our lives. What we are today is accumulation of our past experiences. This means that you have contributed a lot to be whenever you are and still you can change the 
            condition if you make a conscious decision of whom you choose to become. Our actions file up to form our character. Everydays action whether consciously or unconsciously chosen
            determine whom we are. For that reason, its worth having self-evaluation and ask yourself if you continue doing what your'e doing where will you end up at. Small continously repeated habits
            build up your character.

            What makes a person successful? Is there a single attribute which when poossessed can make someone be termed as successful? Undeniably, definition of success varies from one person to 
            another. Even success is an illusion that people chase. Life itself is full of challenges only that the intensity of challenges vary from one person to another.
            Life itself is about the balance of chaos and orderness. Chaos and order are directly proportioned tending to attain the equilibrium.
            The more the chaos, the greater the ordeness. Does this not challenge us to deliberately seek more order related chaos if we want more order?
            This does not call people to be thugs and evils for the sake of orderness. It is a wake up call for being full immersed in actions which seem to be hard and tiresome but eventually are 
            benefitial.

        Back to our questions. What makes a person to be considered successful? Here are some of the general qualities considered to contribute to the measures of success:
        <ol>
            <li style="font-size: larger;"><strong>Family</strong></li><br>
            <img src="images/family.jpg.png"><br><br>
            <p>
                Man is a social being. Family is the basic unit of the society. A well functional society has a well and active family. The smallest unit of a family consists of a father, mother and children.
                The father is the the compass for the family. He guides them on when and what to do,go and eat. To some this sounds like dictatorship but it is not. A masculine man and a feminine woman understands this well.
                If you are a father and do not know the right direction for your family, then you are slowly leading them to a destruction. A good father should have the right mindset and right knowledge on how to progress in life.
                Some of the things that a father have to do for the healthy progress of a family include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Providing for the family</strong></li>
                    A father has to make sure that his family has the basic needs. He should make sure that his wife and children have shelter, clothing and healthy food. A man who cannot provide is doomed to fail as a father. 
                    <li><strong>Having time for the family</strong></li>
                    A father should ensure he is available for his family. This does not mean he should sit at home all the time. Sometimes solitude matters. Detach from them for a moment and give them a chance of missing you.
                    Having time for a having is not just sitting at home and watch what they do. Find activities that get them engaged and active. This can be like; taking a nature walk together, exercising together,praying together,
                    reading together, playing together etc
                    <li><strong>Protecting the family</strong></li>
                    A father has to ensure that his family is secured. He should give them shoulders to lean on when the shit hits the fan. He should be able to save them during their rock bottom moment. A good father stabilises the 
                    emotions of his family. He also have to protect them during the time of financial crisis but ensuring he has a good cash flow. There is not a final destination for all this. It is a matter of step by step as you 
                    enjoy the progress.

                            <li>Meat</li>
                            <li>Eggs</li>
                            <li>Sweet potatoes</li>
                            <li>Yams</li>
                            <li>Pumpkins</li>

                    <li>Exercising</li>
                    <P>A good physique matters a lot. It is always good to examine your physique. Exercising is a great way to maintain a better physique. No person should grow
                        old without seeing the beauty of his body. As Socrates said,"No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man 
                        to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable." To determine the status of your physicality, use this criteria. Stand before a mirror 
                        which enables you to look yourself from toes to the head, remove all the clothes, examine the shape of your body starting from the neck, shoulders, belly, waist and thighs. 
                        Truly answer yourself whether you are happy with what you see. If you are not happy, take action to change for better.

                    </p>
                    <li>Getting enough sleep</li>
                    <P>After you have fully exhausted yourself during the day, it is important that you get a quality sleep. It is during this time that your muscles relaxes and grows. Enough sleep lowers your 
                        cortisol level thus reducing the level of stresses despite of conditions you encounter. Sleep also boost your cognitive health. Fully exhausting yourself without having moments of rest can result to burnout. Just take enough sleep bearing in mind that 
                        too much sleep is as harmful as a little one. 7-8 hours of good sleep are enough. During sleeping time, make sure you observe the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Avoid screenlight 0ne hour before bedtime</li>
                            <li>Have a fixed sleeping routine</li>
                            <li>Switch off the lights during bedtime</li>
                            <li>Do not eat during sleeping time. Eat early enough before you get to bed.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </P>
                    <li>Relaxing</li>
                    <p>After seriously immersing yourself to deep work, you need moments of relaxing. Think of it as the time for re-energizing. During this time, you can either meditate or do simple chores like trimming the flowers, taking nature walk and socializing with others. 
                        But do not overdo it. Know when to resume back to your work. Relaxing does not mean you become a lazy brat. Always fully exhaust yourself before having a time to refresh. Work-life balance is for the average people.
                        Great people first do all their best regardless of their conditions. They do not care if what they are doing will ruin them or mot. They just work and work and work until they accomplish their mission.

                Historically, capacity for better mating has being rated highly by the capability to offer security. Men had to protect their wives and children from the invading enemies. Men could die on the war only to ensure that 
                their families are secure and peaceful. But nowadays men don't go to war. They have to secure their families against famine, poverty and woke virus. A man has to ensure that their is food on the table, wives and children are well clothed, his family has a good shelter and he 
                has to be strong enough to defend them in times of calamities.

                Anciently,people stored their wealth in the goods they had such maize,goats,cows,camels and rice. Nowadays the store of value is money. You should have a good amount of cash to act as security in times of 
                financial crisis. This does not mean money is the end means,it is just mean to the end. Money should not be the primary focus. Money is not the real measure of value. The real measure of value is the labour which gets you money.
